        <h1>How to Make a Cake: Step-by-Step Guide</h1>
        <p>Baking a cake can be a rewarding experience, and with the right steps, you can create a delicious, moist cake every time. Whether you're a first-time baker or looking to sharpen your skills, this guide will walk you through the process. Let’s get started!</p>

        <h2>Ingredients You’ll Need:</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>2 ½ cups of all-purpose flour</li>
            <li>1 ½ cups of sugar</li>
            <li>1 cup of unsalted butter (room temperature)</li>
            <li>4 large eggs</li>
            <li>1 cup of milk</li>
            <li>2 teaspoons of vanilla extract</li>
            <li>2 ½ teaspoons of baking powder</li>
            <li>½ teaspoon of salt</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Step 1: Preheat Your Oven</h2>
        <p>Set your oven to 350°F (175°C). Grease and flour your cake pans or line them with parchment paper to prevent sticking.</p>

        <h2>Step 2: Mix the Dry Ingredients</h2>
        <p>In a large bowl, whisk together the flour, baking powder, and salt. This ensures that the baking powder is evenly distributed, giving your cake a good rise.</p>

        <h2>Step 3: Cream the Butter and Sugar</h2>
        <p>In a separate bowl, use a mixer to cream the butter and sugar together until the mixture is light and fluffy. This process typically takes about 3-5 minutes.</p>

        <h2>Step 4: Add the Eggs</h2>
        <p>Add the eggs one at a time, beating well after each addition. This helps create a smooth batter and incorporates air for a lighter cake.</p>

        <h2>Step 5: Combine Wet and Dry Ingredients</h2>
        <p>Slowly add the dry ingredients to the butter mixture, alternating with the milk. Start and end with the dry ingredients. Add the vanilla extract and mix until just combined. Be careful not to over-mix, as this can make the cake dense.</p>

        <h2>Step 6: Pour Into Pans and Bake</h2>
        <p>Divide the batter evenly between your prepared cake pans. Smooth the tops with a spatula and tap the pans lightly on the counter to release any air bubbles. Place in the oven and bake for 25-30 minutes, or until a toothpick inserted into the center comes out clean.</p>

        <h2>Step 7: Cool and Decorate</h2>
        <p>Allow the cakes to cool in the pans for 10 minutes, then turn them out onto a wire rack to cool completely. Once cooled, you can decorate them as you wish—whether it’s a classic buttercream, fondant, or fresh fruit!</p>

        <h2>Image Prompt:</h2>
        <div class="image-prompt">
            <p><strong>Prompt:</strong></p>
            <p>Create a bright, inviting kitchen scene where a baker is mixing cake batter in a large bowl. The countertop is filled with baking essentials such as flour, sugar, butter, eggs, and a whisk. In the background, you can see a preheated oven and two greased cake pans ready for the batter. The scene should feel warm and homey, with pastel-colored walls and soft lighting. The baker is in the middle of pouring the batter into the pans, and the overall mood of the image should evoke the joy of baking and the anticipation of a delicious homemade cake.</p>
