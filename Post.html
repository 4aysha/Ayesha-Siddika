            <li>Offset spatula</li>
            <li>Piping bags and tips</li>
            <li>Turntable</li>
            <li>Cake scraper</li>
            <li>Food coloring</li>
            <li>Cake boards</li>
            <li>Fondant (optional)</li>
            <li>Decorative toppings (sprinkles, fruits, etc.)</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Step-by-Step Cake Decoration Techniques</h2>

        <h3>1. Preparing the Cake</h3>
        <p>Ensure your cake is completely cooled before decorating. Trim any domed tops with a serrated knife for a flat surface.</p>

        <h3>2. Crumb Coating</h3>
        <p>Apply a thin layer of frosting to seal in crumbs. This will prevent any crumbs from showing through your final layer of frosting. Chill the cake for about 30 minutes to set the crumb coat.</p>

        <h3>3. Applying the Final Coat of Frosting</h3>
        <p>Using an offset spatula, spread a generous amount of frosting over the crumb-coated cake. Smooth the sides and top using a cake scraper for a clean finish.</p>

        <h3>4. Piping Techniques</h3>
        <p>Fill a piping bag fitted with your choice of tip. Practice different piping styles such as rosettes, stars, and borders on parchment paper before decorating your cake.</p>

        <h3>5. Adding Decorations</h3>
        <p>Top your cake with fresh fruits, chocolate shavings, or edible flowers. Consider using fondant decorations for a more polished look.</p>

        <h3>6. Final Touches</h3>
        <p>Dust your cake with powdered sugar or cocoa for a beautiful finish. You can also add metallic sprinkles or edible glitter for an extra special touch.</p>

        <p>With practice and creativity, you can transform any cake into a masterpiece. Enjoy the process of decorating and make every cake a memorable treat!</p>
